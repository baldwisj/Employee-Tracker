# Employee-Tracker

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to view the Employees, Roles, and departments in a business. The app also has funtionality to create a new Department, Role, and employee.

## Usage
This application is used entirely in the terminal. Using Node index.js initiates the app and displays multiple selections to choose from. The selections are formed using the inquirer npm package which is coupled with mysql to provide the functionality to view and/or change the various tables on information.

## Usage
This application implements mysql and data base frame work to create an employee database and several tables of information. The application uses switch cases to move from one functionality to another.

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* I gained a better understanding of mysql and database structure

* I acheived a more thourough knowledge of switch cases and how they can be implemented in an application.

* I created a seed data base to be accessed by the user though table navigation.

* I strengthened my understanding of inquirer
